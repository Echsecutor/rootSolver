Extrapolation test case

Testing whether the fit is accurate:
	preparing data...
	extrapolating...
	calculating exact result...

The extrapolated value (from [0;10] to 42) is 
(40.7151,-0.809614)
(1,0)
(5183.73,-78.1075)
(2239.73,15.5866)
(1858.33,-10.7323)

The exact value is 
(40.7151,-0.809614)
(1,0)
(5183.73,-78.1075)
(2239.73,15.5866)
(1858.33,-10.7323)

The extrapolation error is 1.67827e-08

Done.
