rootSolver
==========

This is a solver (frame work) for solving (complex) one or multi dimensional (non-linear) equations. It is written generically, in particular it can easily be used for complex functions and variables, other than the GSL variant http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/Multidimensional-Root_002dFinding.html  from which this project is completely independend.
